Gilbert Grundy CS250

This program is supppose to imitate a circuit containing a half-adder, and a 
full-adder. Two binary numbers are given by the user through the command line,
and the program shows the steps of addition before printing the binary number
spaced out in 4-bit (bytes) sections with no leading zeros.

The user can do several additions without re-starting the program.
